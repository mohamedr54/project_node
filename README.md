In the home page localhost:4200/learningpackage, you can create packages, we have created some English French and mathematical packages for example. The user can create packages with the create button at the top left and delete them with the button framed in red at the bottom right of each package.

When creating a package, i. e. after pressing the “create” button, a window opens and the user can enter the title of the package, a description, a category and its level of difficulty.

When the user selects a package with the “play” button, he arrives at the localhost:4200/cards page and he can create flashcards with the “create” button on the top right of the page and he has to enter the question and the associated answer. Once done he can press the "submit" button and the card will appear in the package.

When the “edit mode” button at the top left is disabled, the user goes into learning mode as it were. The cards in the package scroll and the user can press the “answer” button to see the answer.

The blue buttons “easy”, “good”, “hard” and “again” should allow, depending on where the user clicks, to reappear the cards at a certain frequency. The harder it was for him, the more frequently the cards should appear. However these blue buttons have not been completed and are therefore not functional.
